/*
 * Asking for location and notification permission, and working out what
 * actually happened.
 *
 * The distinction that matters everywhere below is *recoverable* vs *final*:
 *
 *   - A browser only shows a permission prompt while the state is undecided.
 *     Once the user has explicitly denied, asking again resolves immediately
 *     with `denied` and shows nothing — a RETRY button there would be a button
 *     that visibly does nothing. Only site settings can undo it.
 *   - A prompt the user dismissed without choosing leaves the state undecided,
 *     so retrying genuinely re-prompts.
 *   - Geolocation can also fail for reasons that have nothing to do with
 *     permission (no fix, hardware off, slow GPS). Those are transient and
 *     worth retrying.
 *
 * So the UI offers RETRY exactly when `isRetryable` says so, and otherwise
 * shows a dead end with a pointer at site settings.
 *
 * iOS note: one Apple Developer Forums report describes a geolocation prompt
 * being routed to Safari instead of a Home Screen PWA (iOS 15.1.1). This does
 * not establish a current, general permission-persistence rule. The app asks
 * for location for each bust and already handles denial, dismissal, timeout,
 * and unavailable results; do not infer a persisted grant from a prior call.
 * See PROJECT.md §12 for the scope and source link.
