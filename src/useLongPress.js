 * Long-press gesture for touch, so the hidden debug menu is reachable on a

 *
 * `onContextMenu` alone is a desktop-only gesture. iOS Safari answers a long
 * press with its own text-selection / callout UI and never fires `contextmenu`,
 * which is why holding DELETE ACCOUNT used to just highlight the words. Pointer
 * events give us the same gesture on every platform; the CSS side of the fix
 * (`-webkit-touch-callout: none`, `user-select: none`) is what stops the OS
 * from competing with us for the hold.
