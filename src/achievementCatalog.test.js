/*
 * The achievement catalog exists in two places that must never disagree:
 *
 *   - src/rules.js, which the client and both Edge Functions compute unlocks from
 *   - achievement_catalog in Postgres, seeded by the core schema migration and
 *     referenced by a foreign key on achievements.achievement_type
 *
 * Drift is not a cosmetic problem. Adding an achievement to rules.js without
 * seeding its id makes every unlock of it fail the foreign key, so the whole
 * reconcile call 500s and the user silently stops earning ANYTHING. Removing an
 * id that rows still reference makes the migration itself unappliable.
 *
 * Parsing the migration is deliberate: comparing against a hand-copied list in
 * this file would just move the drift somewhere nobody looks.
