 * "Don't ask me again" for the first-login Permissions dialog.

 * Deliberately localStorage and nothing else. localStorage is scoped per origin
 * per device, which *is* the requested behaviour and needs no detection code:
 *
 *   - same device, different city  -> flag still present -> not re-asked
 *   - different device, same city  -> no flag there      -> re-asked
 *
 * So there is no IP lookup, no timezone check and no fingerprint here on
 * purpose. Storing this server-side against the account would break it, because
 * the preference would then follow the user onto every new device.
 *
 * Scope note: this flag governs the FIRST-LOGIN dialog only. The bust-time
 * re-ask deliberately ignores it — see PermissionGate in main.jsx.
