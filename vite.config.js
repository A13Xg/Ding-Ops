/*
 * A build identity the running app can compare itself against.
 *
 * Two halves that must agree: `__BUILD_ID__` is compiled into the bundle, and
 * `version.json` is emitted beside it holding the same value. The app fetches
 * that file when it returns to the foreground; a mismatch means the page is
 * running an older build than the one deployed.
 *
 * This matters most on iOS, where a Home Screen PWA can keep the same document
 * alive for weeks and will happily run a months-old bundle — including an old
 * push registration path — with no visible sign that anything is stale.
 *
 * GITHUB_SHA when CI provides it, so the id is traceable to a commit; a
 * timestamp locally, which is enough to tell two dev builds apart.
