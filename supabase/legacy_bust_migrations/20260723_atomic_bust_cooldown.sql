-- BUST — atomic Supabase bust cooldown enforcement
-- Repeatable. (Originally written to run after supabase/setup.sql, which has
-- since been folded into 20260913020000_core_schema_baseline.sql.)
--
-- Why this exists:
-- The original RLS-only cooldown check could race when two inserts arrived at
-- nearly the same time. Each transaction could observe the same old
-- last_bust_timestamp before the AFTER INSERT trigger updated the profile.
--
-- This BEFORE INSERT trigger locks the authenticated user's profile row,
-- assigns an authoritative server timestamp, checks the cooldown, and updates
-- last_bust_timestamp inside the same transaction before the insert completes.

-- Verification notes:
-- 1. Run two simultaneous inserts for the same authenticated user. Exactly one
--    should succeed; the other should fail with "Cooldown is still active".
-- 2. Supplying an old timestamp must not bypass the cooldown because the trigger
--    replaces it with clock_timestamp().
-- 3. Supplying another user's user_id must fail with SQLSTATE 42501.
