-- Stamped alongside temperature, pressure, elevation and tide. Nullable and
-- unconstrained beyond a sanity bound: market data is best-effort context, and
-- a bust must never be rejected because a price lookup failed.

-- Repeatable: safe to run multiple times.

-- A push service can reject an endpoint for reasons that are not "gone" (404/410).
-- The important one is 403, returned when the subscription was created without
-- our VAPID key: it never recovers, but nothing prunes it, so the endpoint is
-- retried forever. Count consecutive failures and drop an endpoint that has
-- clearly stopped working. A single success resets the counter to zero.
